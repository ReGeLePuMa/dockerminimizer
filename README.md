# Docker Minimizer

## Description

The aim of the project is to automate the minimzation of Dockerfiles, the recipe files used to construct container filesystem. A minimized Dockerfile is one that generates the minimal filesystem used to run a particular application. The Dockerfile will select the minimal set of files and configuration to run an application.
